    "# Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be used to represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a major in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vocabulary and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex**: A vertex (also called a “node”) is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name, which we will call the **“key”**. A vertex may also have additional information. We will call this additional information the “payload.”\n",
    "- **Edge**: An edge (also called an “arc”) is another fundamental part of a graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a **directed graph**, or a digraph.\n",
    "- **Weight**: Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities.\n",
    "- **Path**: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally we would define a path as `w1,w2,...,wn` such that `(wi,wi+1) ∈ E` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n−1`. The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path, specifically n−1. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path.\n",
    "- **Cycle**: A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a **directed acyclic graph(DAG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph can be represented by `G` where `G=(V,E)`. For the graph `G`, `V` is a set of vertices and `E` is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple `(v,w)` where `w,v ∈ V`. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph s is a set of edges e and vertices v such that `e ⊂ E` and `v ⊂ V`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Graph()` creates a new, empty graph.\n",
    "- `add_vertex(vert)` adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.\n",
    "- `add_edge(fromVert, toVert)` Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `add_edge(fromVert, toVert, weight)` Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `get_vertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "- `in` returns True for a statement of the form vertex in graph, if the given vertex is in the graph, False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to implement a graph is to use a **two-dimensional matrix(Adjacency Matrix)**. In this matrix implementation, each of the rows and columns represent a vertex in the graph. The value that is stored in the cell at the intersection of row v and column w indicates if there is an edge from vertex v to vertex w. When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say that they are adjacent. A value in a cell represents the weight of the edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Adjacency Matrix](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/_images/adjMat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the adjacency matrix is that it is simple, and for small graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes. However, notice that most of the cells in the matrix are empty. Because most of the cells are empty we say that this matrix is **“sparse”**. A matrix is not a very efficient way to store sparse data. The adjacency matrix is a good implementation for a graph when the number of edges is large, Since there is one row and one column for every vertex in the graph, the number of edges required to fill the matrix is `|V|^2`. A matrix is full when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. There are few real problems that approach this sort of connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjacency List\n",
    "\n",
    "A more space-efficient way to implement a sparsely connected graph is to use an **Adjacency List**. In an adjacency list implementation we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to. In our implementation of the Vertex class we will use a dictionary rather than a list where the dictionary keys are the vertices, and the values are the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Adjacency List](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/_images/adjlist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the adjacency list implementation is that it allows us to compactly represent a sparse graph. The adjacency list also allows us to easily find all the links that are directly connected to a particular vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing a Graph in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract data type (ADT) when given a physical implementation then we refer to the implementation as a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any object-oriented programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a **Graph** is the creation of a new class. The Graph operations are implemented as methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using dictionaries, it is easy to implement the adjacency list in Python. In our implementation of the Graph abstract data type we will create a classes `Graph`, which holds the master list of *vertices*, and **edges**.\n",

    "Given a graph `G` and a starting vertex `s`, a breadth first search proceeds by exploring edges in the graph to find all the vertices in `G` for which there is a path from `s`. The remarkable thing about a breadth first search is that it finds all the vertices that are a distance `k` from s before it finds any vertices that are a distance `k+1`.\n",

The inner loop, which is nested is executed at *most once for each edge in the graph*, `|E|`. The reason is that *every vertex is dequeued at most once* and we examine an edge from node u to node v only when node u is dequeued. This gives us O(E. for the for loop, combining the two loops gives us O(V+E).\n",
