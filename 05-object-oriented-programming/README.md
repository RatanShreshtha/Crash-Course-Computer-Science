# Introduction

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. In Object Oriented programming (OOP) related pieces of information and behaviors are grouped together into a template called a **class**. Then individual **objects** are created from the class template. The entire software program runs by having multiple objects interact with objects to create the larger program.

## Why OOP?

OOP makes code organized, reusable, and easy to maintain. It follows the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle used by many programmers to make efficient programs. OOP also prevents unwanted access to data, or exposing proprietary code through encapsulation and abstraction.
