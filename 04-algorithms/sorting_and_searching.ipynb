In Python lists, these relative positions are the index values of the individual items. Since these index values are ordered, it is possible for us to visit them in sequence. This process gives rise to our first searching technique, the sequential search."

For searching, it makes sense to count the number of comparisons performed. Each comparison may or may not discover the item we are looking for.\n",

In the worst case, we will not discover the item until the very last comparison, the nth comparison. On average, we will find the item about halfway into the list; that is, we will compare against `n/2`\n",

We will still have the same number of comparisons to find the item. However, if the item is not present there is a slight advantage. In this case, the algorithm does not have to continue looking through all of the items to report that the item was not found.
